Data acquired by satellites nowadays allow us to have a global view, consistent in time, of the state of our forests, oceans, and growing urban areas. However, such a wealth of data has little value without appropriate processing chains able to convert the pixel values to ... ESA's Director of Earth Observation Programs, Simonetta Cheli, commented, \"We are thrilled today to launch Œ¶sat-2, which will demonstrate the transformative power of artificial intelligence in ... Geospatial artificial intelligence (Geo-AI) methods have revolutionarily impacted earth observation and remote sensing. With the advancement of deep-learning algorithms and the availability of high-resolution geospatial data, significant strides have been made in geospatial artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence technologies have achieved remarkable successes and continue to show their value as backbones in scientific research and real-world applications.ESA's new Œ¶sat-2 mission, launching in the coming weeks, will push the boundaries of AI for Earth observation - demonstrating the transformative potential of AI for space technology.\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3m4 out of the 5 publications are found in the first and second observations.
